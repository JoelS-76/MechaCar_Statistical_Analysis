## Linear Regression to predict MPG

Vehicle weight was the most significant factor in predicting mpg. AWD and spoiler angle were distant followers; the other variables were very likely to contribute random data.

The slope of this regression would be considered zero, as there is little correlation between the majority of variables and mpg. This regression does not predict mpg effectively. Most of the variables are insignificant. It would be more effective, in this case, to run a single linear regression on the vehicle weight data.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

Lot 3 does not meet the specifications, having far too high a variance. The specifications require no more than 100 PSI; lot 3 shows 170.29 PSI.

The data for all lots in total is 62.29, but lot 3 is a rather extreme outlier in the set. The data from lot 3 suggests a problem in production which needs to be addressed.
